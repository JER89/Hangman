### At the very least your version of the hangman should:

* propose an hidden word
* allow the selection of letters
* verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
* count the number of failure (lives)
* check if it's a game over
* check if the word as been found

### Optionally it can:

* keep in memory all guessed letters
* only let the player guess a letter once
* add an image for each step
* check keyboard recognition
